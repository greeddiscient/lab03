1. returns true if the string's first length-1 characters are the same as the string it is being compared to. (abc, abc1). if the character insterted is at the end of the string.

2. returns false if 

3. it doesn't falsely return true on any pairs.

4. it falsely returns false if the character being inserted is in the front or the middle.

5. never crashes.

The bug is in the comparison of Strings. before we used == which is the reference but after i changed it to the built in method .equals() then it corrects itself for everything.
